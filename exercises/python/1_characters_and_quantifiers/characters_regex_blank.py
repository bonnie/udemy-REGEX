# and a single optional exclamation point (!) at the end
yeehaw_regex = r''

# Exercise 2: Match the word “hi”, followed by two or more s’s
# what's the most readable way to write this?

# Exercise 3: Match the word “Yay” with three, four,
# five or six exclamation points at the end
yay_regex = r''

# Exercise 4: Match “Call me maybe” with any number of ?s
