# Write your regular expressions inside the raw string, for example: r'a+'

# Exercise 1: Match the string yeehaw with 2 or more es after the y,
# and an optional exclamation point (!) at the end
yeehaw_regex = r'yee+haw!?'

# Exercise 2: Match the word “hiss” (without quotes), followed by two
# or more s’s, in the most readable form you can.
hiss_regex = r'hiss+'

# Exercise 3: Match the word “Yay” (without quotes)with three, four,
# five or six exclamation points at the end
yay_regex = r'Yay!{3,6}'

# Exercise 4: Match “Call me maybe” (without quotes) with any number of ?s
# at the end (including zero)
